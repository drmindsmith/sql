# sql
Example of SQL processes and use

In the PR.sql file, I list a sequence of processes and functions I used to explore, clean (a little), and analyze the database. 
This database is three tables, from an instance of the 2014 process of evaluating probationary students at the University of Arizona for retention. 

Also attached is the Spring 2015 procedure I developed for the University to streamline the process across all colleges. While it's not the specific version I used for fall 2014, it's based on it with minor improvements.
